/** @name Making multiple waves into a single wave

If multiple input files are specified, by default they are concatenated into 
the output file.
</para>
<para>
<screen>
$ ch_wave kdt_010.wav kdt_011.wav kdt_012.wav kdt_013.wav -o out.wav
</screen>
</para>
<para>
In the above example, 4 single channel input files are converted to
one single channel output file. Multi-channel waveforms can also be
concatenated provided they all have the same number of input channels.

</para><para>

Multiple input files can be made into a multi-channel output file by 
using the -pc option:

</para><para>
<screen>
$ ch_wave kdt_010.wav kdt_011.wav kdt_012.wav kdt_013.wav -o -pc LONGEST out.wav
</screen>
</para>
<para>
The argument to -pc can either be LONGEST, in which the output
waveform is the length of the longest input file, or FIRST in which it
is the length of the first input file.

*/

//@{
//@}

/** @name Extracting channels from multi-channel waves

The -c option is used to specify channels which should be extracted
from the input.  If the input is a 4 channel wave,
</para><para>
<screen>
$ ch_wave kdt_m.wav -o a.wav -c "0 2"
</screen>
</para>
<para>
will extract the 0th and 2nd channel (counting starts from 0). The
argument to -c can be either a single number of a list of numbers
(wrapped in quotes)

 */
//@{
//@}


/** @name Extracting of a single region from a waveform

There are several ways of extracting a region of a waveform. The
simplest way is by using the start, end, to and from commands to
delimit a sub portion of the input wave. For example
</para><para>
<screen>
$ ch_wave kdt_010.wav -o small.wav -start 1.45 -end 1.768
</screen>
</para>
<para>
extracts a subwave starting at 1.45 seconds and extending to 1.768 seconds.

alternatively,
</para><para>
<screen>
$ ch_wave kd_010.wav -o small.wav -from 5000 -to 10000
</screen>
</para>
<para>
extracts a subwave starting at 5000 samples and extending to 10000
samples. Times and samples can be mixed in sub-wave extraction. The
output waveform will have the same number of channels as the input
waveform.

*/
//@{
//@}

/** @name Extracting of a multiple regions from a waveform

Multiple regions can be extracted from a waveform, but as it would be
too complicated to specify the start and end points on the command
line, a label file with start and end points, and file names is used.

The file is called a key label file and in xwaves label format looks
like:
</para>
<para>
<screen>
separator ;
#
0.308272  121 sil ;  	file kdt_010.01 ;
0.440021  121 are ;     file kdt_010.02 ;
0.512930  121 your ;    file kdt_010.03 ;
0.784097  121 grades ;  file kdt_010.04 ;
1.140969  121 higher ;  file kdt_010.05 ;
1.258647  121 or ;      file kdt_010.06 ;
1.577145  121 lower ;   file kdt_010.07 ;
1.725516  121 than ;    file kdt_010.08 ;
2.315186  121 nancy's ; file kdt_010.09 ;
</screen>
</para>
<para>
Each line represents one region. The first column is the end time of
that region and the start time of the next. The next two columns are
colour and an arbitrary name, and the filename in which the output
waveform is to be stored is kept as a field called file in the last column.
In this example, each region corresponds to a single word in the file.

If the above file is called "kdt_010.words.keylab", the command:
</para>
<para>
<screen>
$ ch_wave kdt_010.wav -key kdt_010.words -ext .wav -divide
</screen>
</para>
<para>
will divide the input waveform into 9 output waveforms called
kdt_010.01.wav, kdt_010.02.wav ... kdt_010.09.wav. The -ext option
specifies the extension of the new waveforms, and the -divide command
specifies that division of the entire waveform is to take place.

If only a single file is required the -extract option can be used, in
which case its argument is the filename required.
</para>
<para>
<screen>
$ ch_wave kdt_010.wav -key kdt_010.words -ext .wav -extract kdt_010.03 \
          -o kdt_010.03.wav
</screen>
</para>
<para>
Note that an output filename should be specified with this option.

/** @name Adding headers and format conversion

It is usually a good idea for all waveform files to have headers as
this way different byte orders, sampling rates etc can be handled
safely. ch_wave provides a means of adding headers to raw files.

The following adds a header to a file of 16 bit shorts
