/** \class EST_TBuffer
  * \brief Extending buffer class.
  *
  * This class provides the convenience of arrays which change in size
  * at run time rather more efficiently than the full EST_TVector class
  * would.
  *
  * Buffers can only be expanded and when a buffer is no longer needed
  * (i.e. when the variable goes out of scope) the memory is not deleted,
  * rather it is saved for re-use as a new buffer.
  * 
  * A typical use would be a buffer to hold a windowed section of a signal
  * inside a signal processing loop where the size of the window changes from
  * iteration to iteration.
  * 
  * @see EST_TBuffer.h, Associated definitions.
  * @see EST_TVector, class to use for more general uses.
  * @see lpc_analyse, example of use.
